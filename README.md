# Linux Headers 

This repository is designed to facilitate the building and uploading of Linux headers on demand.

Linux headers are primarily used in eBPF, and this repository aims to streamline the process of compiling Linux headers at runtime. However, it is important to note that you will also need to locate and download the closest matching kernel version.

This repository is based on [Pixie](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie). We extend our gratitude to the Pixie team for their contributions!
